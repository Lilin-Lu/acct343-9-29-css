    <h1>General Ledger & Key Accounts</h1>

    <p>
        Welcome to a simplified overview of basic accounting principles. This page illustrates the fundamental elements of the accounting equation and common account types.
    </p>

    <h2>The Accounting Equation</h2>
    <p>
        The foundation of double-entry bookkeeping is the **Accounting Equation**, which must always remain in balance:
    </p>
    <p>
        **Assets = Liabilities + Equity**
    </p>

    <h2>Main Account Categories</h2>
    <p>
        All accounts fall into one of these five main categories:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Assets:** Resources owned by the company (e.g., Cash, Accounts Receivable).</li>
        <li>**Liabilities:** Obligations owed to outside parties (e.g., Accounts Payable, Notes Payable).</li>
        <li>**Equity:** The owners' claim on the assets (e.g., Common Stock, Retained Earnings).</li>
        <li>**Revenue:** Increases in assets or decreases in liabilities resulting from the delivery of goods or services (e.g., Sales Revenue, Service Revenue).</li>
        <li>**Expenses:** Decreases in assets or increases in liabilities from the costs of generating revenue (e.g., Rent Expense, Salaries Expense).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Impact on Accounts (Debits & Credits)</h2>
    <p>
        Every transaction affects at least two accounts. **Debits** (Dr) and **Credits** (Cr) are used to record these changes.
    </p>
    <table border="1">
        <caption>Normal Balances and Increase/Decrease Rules</caption>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Account Category</th>
                <th>To Increase (Normal Balance)</th>
                <th>To Decrease</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Assets</td>
                <td>Debit (Dr)</td>
                <td>Credit (Cr)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Liabilities</td>
                <td>Credit (Cr)</td>
                <td>Debit (Dr)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Equity</td>
                <td>Credit (Cr)</td>
                <td>Debit (Dr)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Revenue</td>
                <td>Credit (Cr)</td>
                <td>Debit (Dr)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Expenses</td>
                <td>Debit (Dr)</td>
                <td>Credit (Cr)</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
        Understanding these rules is essential for preparing the **Trial Balance** and ultimately, the **Financial Statements**.
    </p>

    <h3>Basic Financial Statements</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Income Statement (shows Revenue and Expenses)</li>
        <li>Statement of Retained Earnings (shows changes in Equity)</li>
        <li>Balance Sheet (shows Assets, Liabilities, and Equity)</li>
        <li>Statement of Cash Flows (shows cash movements)</li>
    </ol>
